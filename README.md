# keepalived_vip

The original [keepalived-vip](https://github.com/kubernetes/contrib/tree/master/keepalived-vip) is neither working for kubernetes 1.11 any more, nor building with current k8s api since lots of thing changed.   

I will make a working version of keepalived-vip for my bare-metal k8s.
